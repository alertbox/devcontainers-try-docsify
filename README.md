### What's included:

Technically, this includes nothing but:

- A simple template found in [@docsifyjs/docsify-template][docsify-template-repo] repo
- Configured to [preview locally](#quick-start), and
- Powered by [Docsify][docsify-js] and [Open Dev Containers][devcontainers-overview]

[docsify-template-repo]: https://github.com/docsifyjs/docsify-template
[docsify-js]: https://docsify.js.org/



## Requirements

See [dev containers][devcontainers-overview] to get started at the most basic level, and:
- A GitHub account, and
- A [Markdown][github-markdown-guides] editor, like [Typora][typora-install], a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for all forms of writing on the GitHub platform

[typora-install]: https://www.typora.io/



## Quick Start

If you are completely new to docsify, the [Quick Start guide][docsify-quick-start] is a good source of information.

Just upload the files to any static web server. Or follow this generic pattern:

First, you want a copy of this repo. It is marked as a `Template` so you will only have to [Use this template][use-this-template] and follow the instructions. Read more about this in [the GitHub's Template Repositories][github-template-repos-help] document.

[use-this-template]: https://github.com/alertbox/devcontainers-try-docsify/generate/
[github-template-repos-help]: https://help.github.com/en/github/creating-cloning-and-archiving-repositories/creating-a-repository-from-a-template



With [Dev Container CLI][devcontainer-cli-commands]:

Just run `devcontainer up devcontainers-try-docsify` in the repo. And that's it. Now you can [write more contents][docsify-write-more] and preview on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

[devcontainer-cli-commands]: https://github.com/devcontainers/cli#try-out-the-cli
[docsify-write-more]: https://docsify.js.org/#/more-pages



With VS Code:

First, run `code devcontainers-try-docsify/` in the repo to open in VS Code, and then it'll prompt to `Reopen in Container`. Do that and we're all set.
